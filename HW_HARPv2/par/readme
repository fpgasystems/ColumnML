NOTE:
=====
- PR bitstreams generated with BDW 502 or an earlier release are NOT compatible with BDW 503 blue bitstream. 
- All AFUs should be recompiled with BDW 503 HW release package to be used with BDW 503 blue bitstream in system.
- The ONLY supported Quartus version for this release is Quartus Prime Pro 16.0.0 Build 211

Compilation Flow:
================
run.sh   - Batch script to run the 2 compile steps required for AFU synthesis.
           Before you run this, be sure to add your AFU source files to bdw_503_pr_afu_synth.qsf
clean.sh - cleans up the run dir and copies SR libs

Remote signalTap:
================
When using remote signalTap, the STP has to be enabled on both project revisions.

AFU sub-floorplan: 
==================
AFU floorplan assignments (if needed) should be added to bdw_503_pr_afu.qsf

AFU SDCs:
========
SDCs required for AFU should be added to bdw_503_pr_afu.qsf

Recommendations:
===============
- User AFUs should be instantiated inside ccip_std_afu.sv
- All inputs and outputs at AFU top level should be registered and floorplanned close to the PR region interface (if necessary)

User Clocks in BDW 503 Release:
==============================
In this project the user clocks at CCI-P interface are statically configured as follows:
uClk_usrDiv2 - 136.37 MHz
uClk_usr     - 272.78 MHz

Ability to program these clocks to arbitrary frequencies will be enabled in a future release.
